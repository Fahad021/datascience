Edge detection is a technique in computer graphics that attempts to find the boundaries of objects in digital images.
The code will take a greyscale image as input and produce a black and white edge image as output.


Theory:

The Sobel filter approximates the magnitude of the local intensity gradient at each pixel coordinate.
Edges are identified when the gradient goes above a given threshold parameter.
The filter employs two 3 Ã— 3 kernels to calculate the gradient at each image coordinate;
one approximates the gradient across rows,
the other across columns.
The row and column gradients are then combined to approximate the maximum magnitude of the intensity gradient.
This computation is applied at each coordinate in the input image in a process known as a convolution.
The magnitude of the gradient can be understood as a score of edge strength.
The larger the gradient the more confident we are of there being an edge at the corresponding coordinate.
The final output image is produced by applying a threshold to the gradient.
If the gradient is above the threshold then the corresponding output pixel is white, otherwise it is black.

'''
We will address this problem by assuming that the pixels on the very boundary of the image are duplicated in imaginary 
rows and columns just outside the image. 
This can be achieved by clamping all row and column coordinates referred to by the kernels to ensure that they always 
stay within the image bounds. 
Any coordinate which goes outside the image bounds can be mapped to its nearest in-bounds neighbour.
